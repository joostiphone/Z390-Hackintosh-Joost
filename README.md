- Always save BIOS settings to a profile for quick recovery in case of resets.

# Sonoma and Ventura on OpenCore
üçá Sonoma and Ventura with OpenCore are working very well. OpenCore EFI files support both Ventura and Sonoma; only difference is OC version and the use of AirPort Itlwm for Intel WiFi.

# Sequoia and Sonoma on OpenCore
üå≤ Sequoia on Opencore is working fine also with a few things to keep in mind: I'm using Heliport+Itlwm, and when installing it needs the HDMI port instead of the DisplayPort. 
So far, Sonoma works with the same EFI, so you can dualboot without any trouble. 

# Tahoe on OpenCore
üèîÔ∏è Working on it...

20-6-2025 Progress has been made:

![alt test](Pictures/TahoeDev1.png)

## üß™ Installing macOS Tahoe Developer Beta 1 on a Z390 Designare Hackintosh (i7-9700K)

üö† **Work in Progress**
Please note: macOS 26 ‚ÄúTahoe‚Äù is still in early developer beta stage. There are multiple unresolved bugs both in Apple‚Äôs system components and third-party kexts. Expect instability, incomplete hardware support, and changes with every beta. Use this only on non-critical systems and with a separate SSD.

---

### ‚úÖ Requirements

* A working Hackintosh system (e.g. running macOS Sequoia or earlier)
* A separate SSD (do **not** install over your main macOS installation)
* OCAuxiliaryTools installed on your working system
* Two provided EFI folders:

  * `20-6-2025 EFI for Installation of Tahoe.zip`
  * `20-6-2025 EFI for Tahoe SSD After Install.zip`

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

#### 0. Create a bootable macOS Tahoe USB stick

Follow the instructions here:
üîó [https://github.com/joostiphone/MacOS-USB-Installer](https://github.com/joostiphone/MacOS-USB-Installer)

---

#### 1. Extract `20-6-2025 EFI for Installation of Tahoe.zip`

This EFI is specifically prepared to boot the macOS Tahoe installer.

---

#### 2. Copy this EFI folder to your USB stick

* Mount the EFI partition of the USB using OCAuxiliaryTools (`‚åò + M` in OCAT)
* Replace any existing `EFI` folder (if there is any) with the extracted one

---

#### 3. Boot the USB and install macOS Tahoe

* Boot your Hackintosh using the USB stick (use BIOS boot menu: `F12`)
* Select ‚ÄúInstall macOS‚Äù from OpenCore
* Be sure to install onto a **separate SSD** ‚Äî this ensures your working system remains untouched

---

#### 4. If installation gets stuck (common in Dev Beta 1):

* Reboot back into your current macOS installation (e.g. Sequoia) by pressing `F12` and choosing Sequoia
* Mount the EFI partition of the SSD where you just installed Tahoe
* Use OCAuxiliaryTools to replace that EFI (if any) with the one from:
  `20-6-2025 EFI for Tahoe SSD After Install.zip`

---

#### 5. Reboot and boot from the macOS Tahoe SSD

* Use the BIOS (`F12`) to select the SSD that now holds macOS Tahoe
* Proceed with the remaining installation steps

---

#### 6. Complete the installation

macOS should now continue and finalize the setup process. Be patient ‚Äî it may reboot several times.

---

#### 7. You‚Äôre in!

If all goes well, you‚Äôll land on the macOS Tahoe desktop.

---

#### üó≠ Notes and Known Issues

* FileVault seems to turn on all of a sudden in macOS Tahoe Dev1, so make sure that you enable automatic login in macOS Settings
* Expect bugs and missing features ‚Äî this is developer-only software



# ‚ö†Ô∏è Precaution
- I'm using OpenCore. You can download the latest build from here which you can use during the EFI creation as per below (or use mine...):
-  https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases
- Also great info from: https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/extras/big-sur/#backstory

- USB preparation and installation of MacOS according this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6fZcFIT82c
- Create your EFI:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyDJMNMFi6I&t=58s
- When the EFI is done, add your SSDT's and DTSD's to the EFI partition using OpenCoreConfigurator to mount the EFI
- After that, create your own Serial Number using OpenCoreConfigurator

# Serial number:
You need to make your own serial number, so that your iCloud etc. will work without using someone else his serial number. In OC GEN-X or in OpenCore Configurator you can generate a new one if you don't have one yet, or if you need a new one.

# Updating Hackintosh (MacOS)
https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/success-gigabyte-designare-z390-thunderbolt-3-i7-9700k-amd-rx-580.267551/
- Make sure you're using the latest stable release of OpenCore and that it works (you can use my efi as per below, or you can update OpenCore yourself)
- In general; watch others do first to see if they succeed
- Make sure first to install the latest Kext files
- Install latest OpenCore; but first make sure that this works according other users. Latest OpenCore build:
https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases

38. 26-1-2023: Updated to MacOS 13.2 (22D49) 
39. 14-2-2023: Updated to MacOS 13.2.1 (22D68)
40. 16-2-2023: Updated to OpenCore v0.8.9
41. 11-5-2023: Updated to OpenCore v0.9.2 and MacOS 13.3.1 (a) (22E772610a)
42. 10-7-2023: Updated to OpenCore v0.9.4 dev. This EFI includes the AirPortItlwm (D02) WiFi driver for Intel based WiFi chips. This is eventually required for WiFi on macOS Sonoma. This EFI is setup as such as a combination with Intel WiFi (AirPortItlwm) and Fenvi Bluetooth. For more information, I'm refering to this topic:
https://forum.amd-osx.com/threads/testing-intel-wifi-itlwm-driver-for-sonoma.4557/page-2
43. 6-8-2023: Updated to OpenCore v0.9.4 dev, without AirPortItlm. I will upload a separate Sonoma version later on to keep this as vanilla as possible.
44. 11-8-2023: Updated to OpenCore v0.9.4 final. Ventura will use Broadcom (Fenvi) and Sonoma will use AirPort Itlwm Preview 05 for Intel WiFi on Sonoma, specifically for Public Beta 5. 

Using the following MinKernel and MaxKernel when using OpenCore to do conditional kext configuration when booting a macOS:
		MinKernel	MaxKernel
Mojave		18.0.0		18.99.99	
Catalina	19.0.0		19.99.99
Big Sur		20.0.0		20.99.99	
Monterey  	21.0.0    	21.99.99
Ventura		22.0.0		22.99.99
Sonoma		23.0.0		23.99.99
Sequoia		24.0.0		24.99.99

# macOS Sonoma (macOS 14)
1. Installing macOS 14.0 beta 1 via the regular Apple channels. 
2. Created a USB. Find the instructions here: https://github.com/joostiphone/MacOS-USB-Installer
3. Created a first EFI based on the Ventura EFI. For Sonoma, I'm now using the latest OpenCore V0.9.4 dev version, and the latest Kext dev versions.
4. Updated to Sonoma beta 3
5. The current EFI is using AirPortItlwm (d02). https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/issues/883 . This means that the Intel WiFi on the Z390 MoBo is being used, instead of the Fenvi (broadcom) WiFi, since macOS Sonoma doesn't support Broadcom chips anymore; which forces us to use the Intel WiFi and AirPortItlwm. The Bluetooth on the Fenvi is still being used.
6. Updated to Sonoma second version of beta 3
7. Updated to Sonoma Public Beta 3 with final OpenCore v0.9.4 and final kexts. This is using AirPort Itlwm Preview 05 for Intel WiFi on Sonoma, specifically for Public Beta 5.
8. Updated to Sonoma RC2 (which will most probably become the Customer version) with final OpenCore v0.9.5 and final kexts. This is using AirPort Itlwm Preview 05 for Intel WiFi on Sonoma, specifically for Public Beta 5 and later.
9. Updated to Sonoma 14.1 with OpenCore v0.9.5.
10. Updated to Sonoma 14.2 with OpenCore v0.9.7.
11. Updated to Sonoma 14.5 with OpenCore v1.0.0.

# macOS Sequoia (macOS 15)
Notes:
Sequoia works, the only thing that isn't working is WiFi (AirportItlwm) and/or Fenvi (Broadcom).

Ethernet works just fine.
During the Sequoia installation, to avoid a black screen, I needed to use my HDMI port instead of the DisplayPort. After the installation the DisplayPort worked again.
Extra settings compared to Sonoma:

Updated all kexts to their beta versions
and added RestrictEvents.kext (don't forget to add -revbeta to boot arguments)
Updated OpenCore to 101 dev version
Using the following boot arguments:
keepsyms=1 debug=0x100 agdpmod=pikera alcid=11 -v -revbeta -lilubetaall -wegbeta -vsmcbeta

1. Installing macOS 15 dev beta 1 on OpenCore 1.0.1 dev. Downloaded via gibMacOS.
2. Upgrading to macOS 15 dev beta 2 on OpenCore 1.0.1 dev. Downloaded via gibMacOS.
3. Added Sequoia boot icons (theme update by Chris1111) and updated OpenCore 1.0.1 dev version.
4. Added WiFi (and AirDrop) support using Heliport+Itlwm on Sequoia. AirportItlwm is still being used when booting into Sonoma. And updated OpenCore 1.0.1 dev version again.
5. Upgrading to macOS 15 dev 24A5331b on OpenCore 1.0.2 dev and latest Kext-betas as per 2-Sept-2024.
6. Upgrading to macOS 15.3 (24D60) on OpenCore 1.0.4 dev and latest Kext-betas as per 4-2-2025. Still using Heliport+Itlwm on Sequoia as Broadcom WiFi doesn't work on Sequoia.
7. 18-3-2025 Z390 OC105DEV Sequoia Itlwm+Heliport NoSN: Itlwm (so don't confuse with AirPortItlwm) is activated with HeliPort to enable onboard Intel WiFi module, instead of using a Broadcom (e.g. Fenvi card) chip. This and future EFI releases is for Sequoia only, hence I stop maintaining the EFI for older macOS versions. Use previous EFI's for that.Upgrading to macOS 15.4 dev () on OpenCore 1.0.5 dev and latest Kext-betas as per 18-3-2025. Using Heliport+Itlwm only on Sequoia.

# Download my EFI's here (zip file):
On the right, here on Github, or download here. It supports Ventura, Monterey and Big Sur. The EFI is without my serial number, so you need to enter your own using OpenCore Configurator in SMBIOS:

# Optionally Overclocking to 5Ghz:
Some basic settings, but you can still look at the attached BIOS screenshots for further details:
- CPU Base Clock: 100Mhz
- Extreme Memory Profile (XMP): Profile 1
- CPU Vcore: 1.370V (instead of standard 1.200V). This is pretty high and cause degration of your CPU, just be aware...
- Active Turbo Ratios: Enabled, and set every core on 50 (50 times 100Mhz CPU Base Clock = 5000Mhz).
- C-States Control: Enable (disable all options there)
